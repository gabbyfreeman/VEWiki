==================
VE Wiki at a glance
==================





This wiki was funded by Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) to assist Oregon MPOs and other stakeholders who would like to use the VE-RSPM for local scenario planning and strategic assessment. This technical resource replaces previous resource guides on strategic models, namely the 2014 RSPM User’s Guide published by ODOT.

Strategic models are a key component of ODOT’s S-T-O-RM Analysis Toolkit, detailed in Figure 1. Strategic models are useful for exploratory testing. MPOs can use strategic models to evaluate how their region’s transportation system will perform in the future under different scenarios. Strategic models are designed for sensitivity testing, or ‘what if’ analyses to help planners understand the relative effect of changes to transportation and land use policy, investments, and programs.
Strategic models differ from other travel demand models that support planning in most urban areas. Strategic models are less detailed but consider a wider range of potential policies and outcomes.

Oregon MPOs can use strategic models to support the Oregon Sustainable Transportation Initiative (OSTI), an integrated statewide effort to reduce greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions from transportation. The initiative was developed to support the state-mandated goal of achieving GHG levels that are 75% below 1990 levels by 2050. 

OSTI is being led by several state agencies: ODOT, the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD) in consultation with the Department of Environmental Quality, the Oregon Department of Energy, and many stakeholder committees made up of businesspeople, elected officials and residents of communities across the state.
